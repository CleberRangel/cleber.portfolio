# Cleber Portfolio
Cleber Portfolio Projects to a show case to companies of my abilities and share knowledge gained during courses and experiencies.

## Folders Structure
Inside source can be found all the source codes for many different languages
* Angular
* C#
* Bootstrap

Inside of each of these folder can be found a project folder with a README.md to help understand the purpose of the project.
In a few cases you can find subfolders for specific topics inside each of these, for example you can find a AWS folder inside C#, this means AWS implementations using C# or experiments are located inside this folder.
